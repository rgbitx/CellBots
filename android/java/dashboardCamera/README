Dashboard Camera for Android
tgnourse@google.com (Thomas Nourse)

This is a dashboard camera (like the dashboard in your car). Also know as a Dashboard DVR. It
records video continually to a sliding window buffer. Once there's an incident (G force over a user
set limit or the user taps the screen) the recent video is written to disk permanently for later.

Note that there is a bug in Froyo (2.2) which causes the camera to seize after a random amount of
usage. This is fixed in Gingerbread (2.3) and did not occur in Eclaire (2.1).
