Balloon Tracker for Android
tgnourse@google.com (Thomas Nourse) and mivey@google.com (Mark Ivey)

This app is a tracking program for balloons and anything else that is being tracked on the APRS
HAM radio network (see http://aprs.fi for examples). However, this app is particularly suited to
balloons because it accounts for elevation and tells you where to point an antenna to best
communicate with the balloon.
