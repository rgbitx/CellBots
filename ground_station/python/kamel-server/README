Author: octav@google.com

Run with KML Python 2.7 on AppEngine dev server.

*** HACK HACK HACK ***
Need to patch line 259 of file
/Applications/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleAppEngine-default.bundle/Contents/Resources/google_appengine/google/appengine/tools/dev_appserver_import_hook.py
so 'a' and 'w' are included in the list of allowed file open modes.
