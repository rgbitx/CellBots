A simple script to monitor a serial stream for NMEA or APRS messages, 
in particular the stream output from the Kenwood DH-72a.

It acts as a relay for the APRS Messages posting them to the kamel-server, 
and announces itself to the kamel-server on valid NMEA messages.

There are several handles that are identified at the top of the script, 
notable the device handle for the serial port, and the address of the 
kamel-server.

Depends on a few modules available in CPAN, please see top of script.
